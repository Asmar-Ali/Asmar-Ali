Senior Software Engineer | Distributed Systems & Cloud Architecture

I specialize in designing and implementing high-scale distributed systems that drive business growth. My focus is on architectural resilience, pragmatic system design, and bridging the gap between complex technical requirements and product goals. I have architected infrastructure for SaaS platforms supporting 40k+ active users and successfully executed legacy migrations to Serverless architectures.


Engineering Highlights
System Scale & Performance

Architected core infrastructure for high-growth platforms generating $1M ARR, ensuring high availability for mission-critical flows.

Engineered real-time state synchronization engines with distributed indexing to enable sub-second data retrieval.

Implemented high-performance hot-stores using Redis, reducing P95 API latency by 60% for global users.

Reliability & Event-Driven Design

Designed fault-tolerant data pipelines using RabbitMQ to process high-volume system events, achieving 99.99% reliability.

Built domain-driven microservices focused on clean architecture, deployed via AWS ECS Fargate for independent scalability.

Legacy Modernization & DevOps

Executed the migration of legacy monolithic codebases to scalable AWS Serverless architectures, delivering 150+ RESTful endpoints.

Engineered end-to-end observability suites with structured logging and the ELK Stack, utilizing distributed tracing to reduce MTTR by 40%.
