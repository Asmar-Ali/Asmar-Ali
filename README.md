**Senior Software Engineer | [cite_start]Distributed Systems & Cloud Architecture** [cite: 10, 36]

I specialize in designing and implementing high-scale distributed systems that drive business growth. My focus is on architectural resilience, pragmatic system design, and bridging the gap between complex technical requirements and product goals. [cite_start]I have architected infrastructure for SaaS platforms supporting 40k+ active users and successfully executed legacy migrations to Serverless architectures. [cite: 12, 16, 26]

### Engineering Highlights

**System Scale & Performance**
* [cite_start]Architected core infrastructure for high-growth platforms generating $1M ARR, ensuring high availability for mission-critical flows. [cite: 12]
* [cite_start]Engineered real-time state synchronization engines with distributed indexing to enable sub-second data retrieval. [cite: 13]
* [cite_start]Implemented high-performance hot-stores using Redis, reducing P95 API latency by 60% for global users. [cite: 15]

**Reliability & Event-Driven Design**
* [cite_start]Designed fault-tolerant data pipelines using RabbitMQ to process high-volume system events, achieving 99.99% reliability. [cite: 14]
* [cite_start]Built domain-driven microservices focused on clean architecture, deployed via AWS ECS Fargate for independent scalability. [cite: 16]

**Legacy Modernization & DevOps**
* [cite_start]Executed the migration of legacy monolithic codebases to scalable AWS Serverless architectures, delivering 150+ RESTful endpoints. [cite: 26]
* [cite_start]Engineered end-to-end observability suites with structured logging and the ELK Stack, utilizing distributed tracing to reduce MTTR by 40%. [cite: 17]
